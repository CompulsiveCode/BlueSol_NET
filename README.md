# BlueSol_NET
A set of wrapper modules and an example program for use with the Blue Soleil SDK, to demonstrate how to interface with each Bluetooth profile.  Most of the profiles are already supported. Only tested under x86 compiling due to heavy use of function pointers and data-type conversions.  All marshalling is done by hand in code, building/parsing structures out of byte arrays.

MAP - Message Access Profile - 95% complete.  

PAN - Personal Area Network - 99% complete.  Maybe 100%.
